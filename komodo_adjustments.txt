Adjustments to Komodo

Install the git tools from https://github.com/jimdoescode/Komodo-Edit-Source-Control-Tools
In the toolbox (right panel):
    right click on the Git tools
    select properties
    change %p to %D in the "start in" category
        this changes them to run in the directory of the currently open file,
        so you need to create a dummy file in the place where you want your
        repo to be first (then you can erase it)

Install Evan_Komodo color scheme (just drag it into Komodo) from Dropbox
